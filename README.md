### Hello World! 👋

👨‍🎓 I'm currently an Aerospace Major at Iowa State University. I am very interested in learning more about aerodynamics and interested in how computational  resourses will help me with reaserching and designing for future aircrafts. 

📖 Here is a link to what I am currently working on learning in AerE 361:
["What I've Learned"](https://github.com/AerE361/mission-1-JFrantz-23/blob/devel-jefrantz/lessons_learned.md)

☀️ Outside of school my hobbies include playing hockey, going to the gym, golfing and hiking.


<!--
